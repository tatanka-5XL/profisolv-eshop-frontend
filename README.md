# Profisolv eshop frontend application

Second part of my eshop application, to be joined with eshop backend. Can be presented also as a simple reference project, however the project core stays on the backend side.
Technologies used - React, Next.js

## How to run the app?

Navigate in the command line to the app folder and run:

`npm install`
